PhotoSwipe Fullscreen Demo
==========================

This is a fork of [PhotoSwipe](http://www.photoswipe.com), the awesome piece of JavaScript that helps display photos on small screens as well as large ones.

This a demo. I used this idea for a while on my own photography site, please **update the example images with your own**.

Changes that I made:
--------------------
- Appends a counter to the image gallery
- Loads PhotoSwipe right away without showing the thumbnails (no need for thumbnails)
- Add a heading to the gallery

Install This Demo On Your Own Site:
-----------------------------------
- Download or fork this repo
- Number your image files as such: '001.jpg', '002.jpg', '003.jpg' through '999.jpg' and place them in the '/images' folder, replacing the existing 4 jpg's.
- Change the value of the NumberOfImages (at the top of main.js, ~line 7) to how ever many photos you have
- Optionally, adjust the {options} object if you want to. These are configuration options for [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe)

I made this demo after seeing [this issue](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe/issues/51) and [this issue](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe/issues/259). As I wanted to do the same thing, I thought that it would be helpful have a demo. :)

This is all based on and built entirely with [photoswipe.js](http://www.photoswipe.com). Code has been changed with permission via the MIT Licence.
