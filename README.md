PhotoSwipe Fullscreen Demo
==========================

This is a fork of [PhotoSwipe](http://www.photoswipe.com), the awesome piece of JavaScript that helps display photos on small screens as well as large ones.

This a demo. I used this idea for a while on my own photography site, please **update the example images with your own**.

Changes that I made:
--------------------
- Append a counter to the image gallery
- Loads PhotoSwipe right away without showing the thumbnails (we have no need for thumbnails)
- Adds a heading to the gallery that shows and hides with user mouse clicks/taps/timeout

Install This Demo On Your Own Site:
-----------------------------------
- Download or fork this repo
- Number your image files as such: '001.jpg', '002.jpg', '003.jpg' through '999.jpg' and place them in the '/images' folder, replacing the existing 4 jpg's.
- Change the value of the NumberOfImages (at the top of main.js, ~line 4) to how ever many photos you have.
- Optionally, adjust [the {options} object](http://photoswipe.com/documentation/options.html) if you want to.

TLDR;
-----

I made this demo after seeing [this issue](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe/issues/51) and [this issue](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe/issues/259) on GitHub. I wanted to do the same thing on my website. I thought that this demo might be helpful for others. :)
