PhotoSwipe Fullscreen Demo
==========================

This is a fork of [PhotoSwipe](http://www.photoswipe.com), the awesome peice of JavaScript that helps display photos on small screens as well as large ones.

This demo is all client side. I used this for a while on my own photography site, please update the example images with your own.

Changes that were made:
-----
- Appends a counter to the image gallery
- Loads PhotoSwipe right away without showing the thumbnails (no need for thumbnails)
- Option to add a heading to the gallery

[View the demo!](http://demos.jonathanbell.ca/photoswipe/)

Make it work on your site:
---
- Download the git repo by clicking the zip button above (or clone this repo)
- Number your image files 001 through 999 and place them in the 'images' folder, replacing the existing 4 jpg's.
- Change the value of the NumberOfImages (at the top of main.js) to how ever many photos you have
- Optionally, adjust the {options} object if you want in order to suite your needs. <a href="#options">See options below</a>.

I made this demo after seeing [this issue](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe/issues/51) and [this issue](https://github.com/codecomputerlove/PhotoSwipe/issues/259). As I wanted to do the same thing, I thought that it would be helpful have a demo. 

This is all based on and built entirely with: [photoswipe.js](http://www.photoswipe.com) - changed with permission via the MIT Licence.
